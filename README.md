This repository have all the files and work that I did as a college student .
There are different types of files :
 1) doctest.h files --These are used ti run my testing files
 2)unintest.cpp --This file contain some test that my program should pass and check if the program works accordingly or not
 3)main.cpp      --This files are used to print the outputs from different functions
 4)fcts.cpp or some other names.cpp --These files contain the functions that solve the problem
 5)fcts.h -- These files contain the name or function prototype
